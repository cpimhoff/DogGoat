  <h1>DogGoat Policy</h1>

  <p>
    Privacy on the internet is increasingly difficult to maintain, because you are super valuable to advertisers. The folks who build DogGoat think you're valuable too, but that you're right to read comedic articles on the internet shouldn't mean selling (more of) your soul to... <span style="color: red;">big coorperations</span>.
  </p>

  <p>
    DogGoat wants to be very clear about what we do and do not do with your computer and personal information.
  </p>

  <h3>Personal Information</h3>
  <p>
    DogGoat only requests information from you we believe is relavanet to the service DogGoat provides. We believe comedians should be known by name, and so we request your full name. There is no terms of use preventing members from giving false names, if they prefer, as long as the name is appropriate. Emails are used for contact, account recovery, and login, but are never shared publically. Passwords are encrypted securely by trusted software not developed by DogGoat. Even the admins of DogGoat can not see the value of your passwords.
  </p>

  <p>
    DogGoat collects and logs certain technical information automatically. This is moderatly boring stuff: information about your connection or what browser you're using. Technical information is logged independent of your account information, so it is anonymous.
  </p>

  <p>
    Personal information will not be shared with anyone except to comply with the law or protect our rights. These are very specific, special circumstances, and we will be as upfront as possible when/if these arise.
  </p>

  <h3>Web Technologies</h3>
  <p>
    DogGoat is powered by a large variety of web technologies, and you can get to know them all, considering DogGoat is <a href="http://www.github.com/cpimhoff/DogGoat" style="display: inline;">open source</a>. However, there are a few in particular we'd like to be upfront about.
  </p>

  <p>
    Cookies are a simple way for DogGoat to ask your browser to store some information for us. Most data, such as all the posts or invitation codes, are stored on DogGoat's servers, however, some stuff only applies to one person, at one time. This kind of data, often refered to as <em>session data</em>, is sent to your browser via a <em>super cookie</em> to store. A super cookie sounds really interesting and cool, but it's just an encrypted cookie. This is done so you can't accidently modify your session data into something which confuses our system. It also prevents other sites from seeing info in your DogGoat cookie (because it's not their business).
  </p>
  <p>
    We don't use tracking cookies. We don't read any information from cookies not issued by us.
  </p>

  <p>
    Webservers track when resources are accessed. This, used in conjunction with images linked in emails, could allow a server to deduce whether or not you read an email sent to you. DogGoat avoids appending resources in this manner for emails sent to you, because we don't think we should be able to tell what your reading from us.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you access any part of DogGoat, you send along your IP address to our server. This is a requirement of almost all servers on the internet. Many IP addresses can be geolocated to a location (think "Brooklyn, New York", not "the kitchen of your house on Maple street" specificity). DogGoat does not try to determine your location based on your IP address.
