# DogGoat

Let's look at comedy on the internet. Yes: cats are great. Oh baby: Buzzfeed really knows how to make a quiz.

Where do comedians go when they have a nice funny piece and don't want to publish a book? The chaotic environment of online forums and share buttons?

DogGoat was created to be an oasis for comedians to share their real work. And it's a hub for readers who want well crafted humor.
