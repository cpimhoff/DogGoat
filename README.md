# DogGoat

**DogGoat**, perhaps despite the title, is not about stuff like cat gifs. It's about real comedians sharing their real work. It's not about *LOLs* per minute, or share buttons, it's about comedians having a confident place to post what they have been working on and see what sticks. It's a hub for readers to find consistently cutting edge humor. It's bits, not gags.

**DogGoat** is a webapp built on top of RubyOnRails and a relational database. Primary development has been on the part of *Charlie Imhoff* and is licensed under Apache License (Version 2.0).
